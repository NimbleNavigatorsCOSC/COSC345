            Experience thus far
            In relation to previous experiences that we had, we as a team, were introduced to
            many novelties that were apparent during the development of our project. Challenges we faced
            were our shortage in skill sets, experience and knowledge in managing a smartwatch app. development
            project. Here, a complication we encountered was developing the emulator. We initially attempted to
            create this first without any writing in the application, however we discovered that further down in
            the developing timeline we would run the risk of implementing something we don't need and/or not
            implementing something we needed. Therefore, we had taken a step back and revisited our design as we
            may possibly downscale our project, removing aspects of allowing users to directly input their music,
            to a simpler design so that we are able to create a completed product that meets our project objectives
            within the time frame given. We had intended to implement team project techniques, such as pair
            programming (if be needed), to improve our productivity and efficiency.

            Our estimated timetable for this project is:<br>
            23rd May - 12th August: 12 weeks - Finished system phase<br>

        <h2>Going Forward</h2>
        <p>
            Collectively we will periodically revisit our design, monitoring our progress level to
            judge whether a downscale(or even perhaps an upscale) is needed for this project to accommodate
            workload. Majority of the time, Thomas will mainly be coding and testing our emulator and
            prototypes, where Allan and Benjaman will mainly be testing and writing the reports. During
            this phase, we aim to practice the test-fix-test cycle effectively, finish our emulators and
            prototypes, and to test it vigorously.
            In our final phase (13th August - 7th October), porting, we will collectively attempt to port
            our prototype on another emulator provided by teams that are similar to ours.

            Here is a basic representation of our app. This is the main screen which displays
            the clock and has touch navigation buttons to go to the stop watch component, the
            customise component and the set alarm component of the app.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/img/design1.png" alt="main screen" title="Main Screen">
        <p>
            Here is what it looks like with an image which the user will be able to change. The with the included <!-- I don't even know -->
            we may need to change the location of the time as it might get in the way of the focus of the picture so each
            picture may also alter the layout. Perhaps if we manage to allow the user to add their own images we could
            allow them to freely move the location of the time.<br>
            This representation of the app also resembles the resolution of the watch.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/img/design5.jpg" alt="meow" title="Main Screen with kitten">
        <p>
            This next screen is the interface for setting the alarm clock. It has plus and
            minus buttons for both hours and minutes. It also has a cancel and a save and exit button.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/img/design2.png" alt="set alarm" title="Set Alarm">
        <p>
            This screen allows the user to choose a tone to play as the alarm. The user can switch to
            a menu where they can select a background for the app too and a font and border design.

            This image shows the stop watch portion of the app. The user can tap the screen anywhere
            but the cancel button to start the stop watch. It will count up until the user touches
            the screen again.

            The emulator will have a 320 by 320 pixel screen to mirror the size of the smart watch. Clicking on
            the screen will be like touching it on the watch. Each time the emulator is 'touched' it will send the
            location of the touch (x and y coordinates) to the app. The app will manage what to do with this
            information. The emulator will get information about the time from the browser and send it to the app.
            The emulator will receive information from the app telling it what kind of graphical information to display
            and what sounds to play.<br>
            The emulator will feature two buttons one will simply exit out of the app returning to the 'home page' of
            the smart watch. The other could be used to perform the same function as some of the touch commmands such as
            stopping and starting the stopwatch aspect or saving and exiting when setting the alarm.
