            <h2>Main Repository</h2>
            <p>A GitHub organisation was created, and the repository ownership transferred to it, for better 
            organisational management. The repository now resides at:

                Experience thus far
                In relation to previous experiences that we had, we as a team, were introduced to
                many novelties that were apparent during the developments of our project. Challenges we faced 
                were our shortage in skill sets, experience and knowledge in managing a smartwatch app. development 
                project. Here, a complication we encountered was developing the emulator. We initially attempted to 
                create this first without any writing in the application, however we discovered that further down in 
                the developing timeline we would run the risk of implementing something we don't need and/or not 
                implementing something we needed. Therefore, we had taken a step back and revisited our design as we 
                may possibly downscale our project, removing aspects of allowing users to directly input their music, 
                to a simpler design so that we are able to create a completed product that meets our project objectives 
                within the time frame given. We had devised to implement team project techniques, such as pair 
                programming (if be needed), to improve our productivity and efficiency.

            <h2>Revised Estimates</h2>
            <p>The updated costing to date for this project are:</p>
            <p>Living expenditure ($400 pp pw): - $ 36,000</p>
            <p>Training cost (software, facilities and tuition): - $700</p>
            <p>Equipment cost/assets (computers, softwares, appliances, smartwatches): - $5,800</p>
            <p>Real estimate expenses: 	Space rental - $ 10,000 pa	Furniture - $ 2,500</p>
            <p>Public utilities and consumables: $ 5,500</p>
            <p>Business Insurance: $ 750</p>
            <p>Grand total: $61,250.<br></p>
            <p>Our current estimated timetable for this project are:</p>
            <p>23th May - 12th August:	12 weeks - Finished system phase</p>
            <p>13th August - 7th October:	 8 weeks - Porting phase</p>

            <h2>Going Forward</h2>
            <p>Collectively we will periodically revisit our design, monitoring our progress level to 
            judge whether a downscale(or even perhaps an upscale) is needed for this project to accommodate 
            workload. Majority of the time, Thomas will mainly be coding and testing our emulator and 
            prototypes, where Allan and Benjaman will mainly be testing and writing the reports. During 
            this phase, we aim to practice the test-fix-test cycle effectively, finish our emulators and 
            prototypes, and to test it vigorously.
            In our final phase (13th August - 7th October), porting, we will collectively attempt to port 
            our prototype on another emulator provided by teams that are similar to ours.</p>

            <h2>Design Notes</h2>
            <p> 
                Here is a basic representation of our app. This is the main screen which displays 
                the clock and has touch navigation buttons to go to the stop watch component, the 
                customise component and the set alarm component of the app.
            </p>
            <img src="assets/img/design1.png" alt="main screen" title="Main Screen">
            <p>Here is what it looks like with an image which the user will be able to change</p>
            <img src="assets/img/design5.jpg" alt="meow" title="Main Screen with kitten">
            <p>
                This next screen is the interface for setting the alarm clock. It has plus and 
                minus buttons for both hours and minutes. It also has a cancel and a save and exit button.
            </p>
            <img src="assets/img/design2.png" alt="set alarm" title="Set Alarm">
            <p>
                This screen allows the user to choose a tone to play as the alarm. The user can toggle to
                a menu where they can select a background for the app too and a font and border design.
            </p>
            <img src="assets/img/design3.png" alt="set tone/background" title="Set Tone/Background">
            <p>
                This image shows the stop watch portion of the app. The user can tap the screen anywhere 
                but the cancel button to start the stop watch. It will count up until the user touches 
                the screen again.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Emulator ideas</h2>
            <p></p>The emulator will be a 300 by 300 pixel screen to mirror the size of the smart watch. Clicking on
            the screen will be like touching it on the watch. Each time the emulator is 'touched' it will send the
            location of the touch (x and y coordinates) to the app. The app will magange what to do with this
            information. The emulator will get information about the time from the browser and send it to the app.
            The emulator will recieve information from the app telling it what kind of graphical information to display
            and what sounds to play.<br>
            The emulator will feature two buttons one will simply exit out of the app returning to the 'home page' of 
            the smart watch. The other could be used to perform the same function as some of the touch commmands such as
            stoping and starting the stopwatch aspect or saving and exiting when setting the alarm.</p>
