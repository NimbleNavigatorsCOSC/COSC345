        <h2>Tools we used</h2>
        <p>
            Github was a very useful tool that allowed us to keep all our code online for all of us to access at anytime.

        <h2>Social Dynamics</h2>
        <p>
            One of the biggest issues we faced was that our schedules made it hard to find a suitable time for meeting together.
            We overcame this by using facebook chat to communicate so that we could just post messages when we were free to do so.
            The problem with this however is that communication could be very slow. Sometimes someone would message in the
            morning and only be replied to in the evening when they were busy and so they would see the reply the next day.
            To deal with problems with schedule in the future, we could set a standard meeting time so everyone knows to plan
            around that time. Another issue was the difference in experience. One member was very well versed in dart whereas
            the others were not and struggled to pick it up. Fortunately the others could perform other tasks to keep the project
            going smoothly as people could take on a specialised role. The problem with this was that it was hard for memebers
            to keep track of what exactly was going on at any point in time. Due to the scheduling problem mentioned before,
            this could mean people were out of the loop for a while before they could catch up.
        </p>

    <div id="experience" class="row">
        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>
            When performing certain tasks for the project some of our members needed to pick up new skills,
            one member was proficient in HTML, CSS and Dart and was able to get us started. As we progressed other members
            went off on their own and learnt new skills in order to help out. Certain online resources, such as w3schools.com,
            were very helpful to teach our less skilled members how to write the HTML reports. Another tool that two of our
            members were new to was our version control system, Github. Fortunately one of our members could help the others
            out and we learnt how to use this tool well. It made managing our code easy as it was all in one place and we could
            see what had been done to it. The experience we had from using the tools (editors (WebStorm) and debugging (Dartium))
            and programming language (Dart) differed for all members. For some, these tools were very familiar to them which
            allowed a very pleasant experience, without a lot of disruption due to the inexperience of using the tools. For others,
            difficulties were obvious, such as using the WebStorm for the first time and trying to figure out how debugging works
            and syntaxes for the Dart programming language. Logically, we followed the procedure and guidelines that the most
            experienced members used.
