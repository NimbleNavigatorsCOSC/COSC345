        <h2> Structure and interface</h2>
        <h3>Emulator</h3>
        <p> Our emulator provides support for single touch and swipe movements. Clicking on a point on the emulator screen will send the coordinate information to the app to be interpreted by the alarm clock application. Swiping the screen gives scrolling functionality to some of the menu screens. The emulator also relays time information which it recieves from the browser. 
        </p>

        <h3>Prototype</h3>
        <p> Our app takes timing and 'touch' information from the emulator that runs it. Depending on the touch input the app will switch between screens or select items on a screen. The app will take the time from the emulator and display it. If the time corresponds to the time set in the alarm clock portion of the app it will play the sound specified through customisation for about 10 seconds.
        </p>
        <h4>Usage</h4>
        <p> Opening the emulator will start up the app. The initial screen is the main screen of the app and contains the current time, and three buttons. The button at the top left is the stop watch button. Clicking this takes you to the stopwatch portion of the app. This part lets you click the screen to start the stopwatch and then click again to stop. There is a return button in the bottom right corner to go back to the main screen. The button to the bottom right goes to the set alarm portion of the app. In the middle of the screen is the current time the alarm will go off at, this defaults to 12:00 AM. There are plus buttons above both hour and minutes and minus buttons below. Clicking these changes time accordingly. Clicking save and return sends you back to the main screen and keeps the time stored. Clicking cancel leaves the previous setting. In the bottom left of the main screen is a button leading to the customise feature. Opening up the customise portion of the app lets you change the tone, background, text and UI colour. Each of these screens has a save and return or a cancel button where cancel leaves the settings the way they previously were. </p>

        <h2>Tools we used</h2>
        <p> Github was a very useful tool that allowed us to keep all our code online for all of us to access at anytime. Being able to simply download all of the files as a zip file so that we could just extract and run it from anywhere was a good feature. Leaving notes for when things were changed was also a useful feature.

    <div id ="browsers" class ="row">
        <h2>Compatible browsers</h2>
        <p>Our application is known to work in Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari and Microsoft Edge.</p>

    <div id="dynamics" class="row">
        <h2>Social Dynamics</h2>
        <p>
            One of the biggest issues we faced was that our schedules made it hard to find a suitable time for meeting together.
            We overcame this by using facebook chat to communicate so that we could just post messages when we were free to do so.
            The problem with this however is that communication could be very slow. Sometimes someone would message in the
            morning and only be replied to in the evening when they were busy and so they would see the reply the next day.
            To deal with problems with schedule in the future, we could set a standard meeting time so everyone knows to plan
            around that time. Another issue was the difference in experience. One member was very well versed in dart whereas
            the others were not and struggled to pick it up. Fortunately the others could perform other tasks to keep the project
            going smoothly as people could take on a specialised role. The problem with this was that it was hard for memebers
            to keep track of what exactly was going on at any point in time. Due to the scheduling problem mentioned before,
            this could mean people were out of the loop for a while before they could catch up.
        </p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>
            When performing certain tasks for the project some of our members needed to pick up new skills,
            one member was proficient in HTML, CSS and Dart and was able to get us started. As we progressed other members
            went off on their own and learnt new skills in order to help out. Certain online resources, such as w3schools.com,
            were very helpful to teach our less skilled members how to write the HTML reports. Another tool that two of our
            members were new to was our version control system, Github. Fortunately one of our members could help the others
            out and we learnt how to use this tool well. It made managing our code easy as it was all in one place and we could
            see what had been done to it. The experience we had from using the tools (editors (WebStorm) and debugging (Dartium))
            and programming language (Dart) differed for all members. For some, these tools were very familiar to them which
            allowed a very pleasant experience, without a lot of disruption due to the inexperience of using the tools. For others,
            difficulties were obvious, such as using the WebStorm for the first time and trying to figure out how debugging works
            and syntaxes for the Dart programming language. Logically, we followed the procedure and guidelines that the most
            experienced members used.
