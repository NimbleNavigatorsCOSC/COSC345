                    <td> <!-- Benjamin -->
                        My strength would be to review each aspect of the assignment to keep track of where the
                        group is up to and make sure that things are working together. I can aggregate the information
                        and create documentation to help our group keep track of the assignments progress.
                        I would also be good at testing the code and thinking of scenarios to put it through to
                        see if it holds up. I have a basic knowledge of HTML.
                    </td>
                    <td> <!-- Allan -->
                        I have basic experience coding in HTML and CSS.  My biggest strength would be a
                        ‘willing to do anything’ attitude, thus any task such as testing, and organising,
                        I would be happy to do so. In support of this, via another strength I believe being
                        slightly OCD, would aid my ability in picking up mistakes. My most considerable weakness
                        would be to write clean, and straightforward style English.
                    </td>
                    <td> <!-- Thomas -->
                        My strengths are in programming and problem solving. I have reasonable experience with
                        multiple programming languages over 4-5years. I’m also fairly familiar with HTML, CSS and
                        Javascript, having done some minor web development for personal projects. I do not have any
                        experience with the &lt;canvas&gt; element as of yet, but I am always willing to pick up new
                        skills. I have experience using VCS, mainly Git &amp; Mercurial. My main weakness is the
                        “communication” side, like writing reports.

            <p>
                Our smart watch application will be a customizable alarm clock / timer / stopwatch. It will be able to
                measure time and make sounds that the user can choose. The user will also be able to put their own
                sounds and tunes into the program so that they can make it unique to them.

            <h2>Version Control System</h2>
            <p>
                We will be using the Git VCS, with the repository hosted on GitHub. We chose this as one of the group
                members is already familiar with it, as well as it’s reasonably easy to use, and GitHub offers a very
                user friendly experience.

        <div id="programming_language" class="row">
            <h2>Programming Language</h2>
            <p>
                We will use Dart as the programing language as it is much more sane than Javascript, offering a type
                system as well as a class system. It is also much more featureful with a comprehensive set of libraries.
                It compiles to Javascript making it compatible with the browser.

        </div>
        <div id="editor" class="row">
            <h2>Editor</h2>
            <p>
                We have chosen to use WebStorm as our editor as it is very powerful with great features for code
                completion, inspection and debugging. It targets web development so it strongly supports HTML, CSS,
                Javascript as well as Dart (through use of a plugin). It has project templates and management tools
                for easy building and testing. It also has inbuilt support for VCS including Git.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="debugging" class="row">
            <h2>Debugging</h2>
            <p>
                Dart offers a special build of Chromium with the Dart VM included called Dartium, allowing us to test
                and debug the Dart script without first compiling to JavaScript. This means we can use the Chrome
                Developer Tools to debug the script in the browser. WebStorm also offers tools for debugging.

                First we will create the emulator and so that it is functional with multiple browsers. We will focus on
                Chrome and Firefox. We assume this will take about a few weeks with 2-3 hours a day on it. One of our
                members has experience with JavaScript, it will take some extra time for the other members to catch up
                and so we will dedicate a few extra hours for that. We will also need to learn how to use Dart so that
                will also take up some of the time. We will also begin creating a basic version of our application to
                begin with to test it with the emulator. As our emulator begins to function correctly we will then move
                onto improving the application to create a finished product. We assume this will take a few weeks. This
                time will include the checking and debugging to make sure it’s working properly.

                Our estimated timetable for this project are:<br>
                10th March - 14th April:     5 weeks - Design and planning phase<br>
                15th April - 26th May:       6 weeks - Training and draft system phase<br>
                27th May - 12th August: 11 weeks - Finished system phase<br>
                13th August - 7th October:   8 weeks - Porting phase
            </p>
            <p>
                In the design and planning phase, all members will collectively research and contribute to ideas,
                deciding selected variables (version control system, programming languages, editors and debuggers), and
                allocating roles. A repository will be set up during this time for our project.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the training and draft system phase, all members will learn or revisit selected variables. Thomas
                will mainly be coding and testing during this phase, where Allan and Benjaman roles will mainly be
                testing, and writing reports. During this phase we will aim to build as much of the emulator and
                prototypes as possible, enabling us to test it.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the finished system phase, Thomas will again mainly be coding and testing, where Allan and Benjaman
                will mainly be testing and writing reports. During this phase, we aim to finish our emulators and
                prototypes, and to test it vigorously.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the final phase, porting, we will collectively attempt to port our prototype on another emulator
                provided by teams that are similar to ours.

            <h2>Risk Management</h2>
            <p>
                A risk is our capabilities, while we are still undergraduates in the field of computer science, we may
                not have the required skills to successfully complete project. To overcome this, we have online
                resources and mentors readily available to aid us. Lastly, another risk is our specialised roles, as
                some of us are more talented in certain fields, in this case coding, we have the risk of collapsing if
                that member decides to leave or fall ill, this will halt our progression line. To work around this, we
                have devised all members to work on all parts of the project, whether it be a small portion or large,
                thus we are always inclusively advised on what is happening.
