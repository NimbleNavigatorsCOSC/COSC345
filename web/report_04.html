    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            An Emulator allows modulation and encapsulation of an application if implemented properly. In our smart 
            watch application, the emulator provides the information that is asked by the prototype without contatcting a browser. In essence, the prototype 
            decides what information is to be displayed while the emulator is responsible for how that is implemented; 
            all while the prototype does not know that the ‘browser’ (source of where the emulator gathers information) exists. 
            This system design essentially permits porting of the prototype application via suitably integrated emulators.</p>
        <p>
            The final task of our smartwatch application development is to port our prototype to an emulator 
            from another group doing the same task.

        <h3>Planning for porting phase</h3>
        <p>
            <u>Our estimated timetable for this project is:</u><br>
               13th August - 7th October: 8 weeks.
          </p>
        <p>
            In this final phase, porting, we will collectively attempt to port our prototype on another emulator that is 
            provided from a team who have been given the same project task.
        </p>
         <p>For the initial two weeks of the porting phase, we will study the given emulator and it’s code, as well as 
             revisiting our own emulator and prototype code.Here we aim to compare and contrast our emulator 
             and the given emulator, as well as what our prototype demands and what the given emulator provides 
             (what request it deals with).<br>
             The following five weeks of the porting phase will be heavily based on attempting to port our prototype 
             to the given emulator. Depending on how much our emulators differ, we may have to conform the given emulator 
             to the way we want to allow porting while maintaining modularity and encapsulation.
             The final week of the porting phase will be used to add our final thoughts to the written report on our endeavor to port
             our prototype to the given emulator.
         </p>
        <h3>Analysis of difficulties porting to X</h3>
                    <p>Porting our prototype to the given emulator was a very challenging task. As our prototype and the 
                    given emulator provided and used different functions, such as our prototype needing a swiping 
                    function and the emulator providing a draw and geo location functions, we had to change the emulator 
                    to fit around our needs.<br>
                    Despite the functions, reading the emulator’s code was difficult as there were minimal documentation written, 
                    so we had to spend some time decoding what did what and what we could use. 
                    In addition to this, the aim to keep everything encapsulated and modular was extremely difficult, as we 
                    were severely tempted to just add in functions so that the prototype application and the emulator 
                    could be in use.<br> Another contributing factor that was apparent was the lack our own abilities and 
                    knowledge to strategically attempt porting, thus we did not successfully port our prototype 
                    application to the emulator. 
                </p>
                <h3>Critique of X documentation and examples</h3>
                <p>
                    The only information given about the code is within the code itself, there is no specific documentation. 
                    The documentation within the code file is very basic, it does not summarise the features that the 
                    emulator provides or warn of any limitations that the code has.<br>
                    The file, emulator.js, starts off with unlabeled variables without a comment block stating what the file does, 
                    who created it and such. In contrast, all functions have very basic documentation. Specifically, it declares 
                    what the parameters and return values are, and a one-line description of its purpose. There is no explanation 
                    as to how the method works without reading through the code and figuring it out for ourselves. Also, the local 
                    variables didn’t have any comments however, for majority of them it was not too difficult to discover what 
                    they do as their purpose is limited within the context of the function. 
                </p>
                <h3>Critique of X structure and code quality</h3>
                <p>
                    The code itself is contained in one big file making it harder to navigate.The structure of the code is 
                    logical given that it’s all in one big file, global variables are up top, methods that are relevant to 
                    each other are grouped together. It could have been separated out into different files to make it easier 
                    to read through. Also having it all in one file makes it hard to tell what parts of the code are related 
                    as changing things that may seem independent could cause unforeseen consequences.<br>
                    The functions are nicely set up with each parameter and return value explained in comments above the method. 
                    The methods aren’t too complex or long so it’s not hard to read through them.<br>
                    The given emulator doesn’t have support for swiping which is something our prototype made use of. In addition, 
                    a lot of the functions in their emulator are for geo location, which we won’t need to make use of as our prototype 
                    doesn’t involve any geo location functions.<br>
                    Overall, the structure quality isn’t too bad where it does follow ‘some’ standards and the layout was presented 
                    cleanly, however the documentation was not adequate enough. The code quality is satisfactory as it was simple 
                    and ‘clear’ with most variables having suitable names. This allowed us to identify what the variables and 
                    functions provide, even without proper documentation.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
            In conclusion, porting a prototype application to an anonymous emulator is no easy task. An important part of making it
                successful is to have excellent documentation that allows programmers to understand it easily, and to have 
                well structured and high quality code that clearly illustrates the functions and uses that follow code conventions 
                with thorough commenting. In our attempt to port our prototype application to the given emulator, we were 
                unsuccessful as we lacked the essentials as well as other contributing factors, such as time comstraints and experience.
