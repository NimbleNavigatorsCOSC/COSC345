            <h2>Critique of documentation and examples</h2>
                 <p>
                 The only information about the code is within the code itself; there is no specific documentation. The documentation within the code file is very basic, it does not summarise the features that the emulator provides or warn of any limitations that the code has. </p>
<p>The methods have very basic documentation. Really all it says is what the parameters and return value is and a little description of the method. There is no explanation as to how the method does what it does without reading through the code and figuring it out for ourselves. Also the local variables don’t have any comments but it’s not too bad as it’s easy to figure out what they do as what they do is limited within the context of the function. There aren’t very many local variables used throughout the methods anyway.</p>
<p>A good thing is that the emulator code has comments for all of its global variables to tell us what it is they are for. This is useful as it makes it easier to predict where to find the variables and what values the store when we find them.

            <h2>Critique of structure and code quality</h2>
            <p>
            The code itself is contained in one big file making it harder to navigate.The structure of the code is logical given that it’s all in one big file, global variables are up top, methods that are relevant to each other are grouped together. It could have been separated out into different files to make it easier to read through. Also having it all in one file makes it hard to tell what parts of the code are related as changing things that may seem independent could cause unforeseen consequences.</p>
<p>The functions are nicely set up with each parameter and return value explained in comments above the method. The methods aren’t too complex or long so it’s not hard to read through them.</p>
<p>Their emulator doesn’t have support for swiping which is something our app made use of.
A lot of the functions in their emulator are for geo location which we won’t need to make use of as our app doesn’t involve geo location.
